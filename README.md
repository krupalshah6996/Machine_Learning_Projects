1. Finding_Donors_for_Charity: Investigated factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made based on real census data. Developed a naive classifier to compare testing results to. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the likelihood of donations. Selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm efficiency.

2. Customer Segements: Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.

3. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10 Augmentation:  Investigated the famous CIFAR-10 dataset and trained CNN and MLP on normal and augmented images from the CIFAR-10 database. Image augmentation technique proved to be more useful in increasing the accuracy of the model.

4. MNIST: Trained an MLP to classify images in the MNIST dataset.

5. Spam_Classification: Implemented Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. Investigated several features which are very common in spam messages. Model is trained on 'smsspamcollection' dataset from UCI's Machine Learning Datasets repository.

6. Predicting_Student_Admission: Implemented model to predict whether a student would get admission or not based on three parameters: 1. GRE Score, 2. GPA Score and 3. Class Rank.
